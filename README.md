## About

Schlieren imaging is a fascinating optical technique used to visualize and study variations in the refractive index of a transparent medium, such as air. This method enables the visualization of normally invisible changes in air density and temperature, making it particularly valuable in fields like fluid dynamics and aerodynamics. By using a light source, a collimating lens, and a knife edge, Schlieren imaging produces striking images where variations in the medium's refractive index appear as patterns of light and shadow. This allows researchers to observe phenomena like shock waves, heat convection, and supersonic flows. Schlieren imaging finds applications in diverse areas, including aerospace engineering, physics research, and material science, providing a unique insight into the behaviour of gases and fluids that would otherwise remain hidden to the naked eye.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rajverma328/Schlieren_imaging_for_fuel_sprays.git

## Usage

1. Set the parameters of the process as per your requirements
2. Select the folder that contains '.tiff' images of the process
3. Wait for the process completion and check for results

## Features

give the average and standard deviation along with the processed output from the image data
